# This is a basic script to checkout the mplayer source from svn and set things
# up for building source and binary packages. This includes creating the
# debian/changelog file and replacing mplayer's debian directory with our own.
#
# It also updates existing svn source if it's already been checked out.
#
# Currently this is very simple and probably won't handle errors very well.
